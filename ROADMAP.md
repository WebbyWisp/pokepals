## üîÑ Iteration Strategy

Each phase follows this pattern:

1. **Planning**: Define specific tasks and acceptance criteria
2. **Development**: Implement core functionality
3. **Testing**: Verify features work as expected
4. **Refinement**: Polish and improve based on testing
5. **Documentation**: Update docs and prepare for next phase

## üìä Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics

- Extension loads in under 500ms
- No memory leaks during 8+ hour sessions
- Works on VS Code stable and insiders
- Compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux

### User Experience Metrics

- Smooth 60fps animations
- Intuitive interactions
- Accessible to screen readers
- Theme-aware styling

### Functionality Metrics

- Activity tracking accuracy >95%
- Save/load reliability 100%
- Wild encounter rates balanced
- Achievement unlock flow working

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guidelines

### Code Quality

- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Comprehensive unit tests for core logic
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Regular code reviews

### User Testing

- Internal testing after each phase
- Beta testing program in Phase 5
- Accessibility testing throughout
- Performance testing on various machines

### Documentation

- Inline code documentation
- User-facing feature documentation
- API documentation for extensibility
- Troubleshooting guides

## üö® Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

- **Performance**: Regular profiling and optimization
- **Compatibility**: Testing on multiple VS Code versions
- **Data Loss**: Robust save/backup systems
- **API Changes**: Monitor VS Code extension API updates

### Timeline Risks

- **Scope Creep**: Strict phase boundaries
- **Technical Debt**: Regular refactoring cycles
- **External Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies
- **Resource Constraints**: Realistic scope for available time

## üìù Notes for Developers

- Each phase should be fully functional before moving to the next
- Regular commits and progress tracking essential
- User feedback should influence later phases
- Keep the core experience simple and polished over adding complexity
- Focus on the cozy, non-intrusive user experience throughout
